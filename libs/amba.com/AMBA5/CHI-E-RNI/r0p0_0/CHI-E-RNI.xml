    <spirit:description>The CHI RNI interface is used by IO coherent nodes such as GPUs and IO bridges. The RNI interface consists of the following VCs:
 - TXREQ
 - TXRSP
 - RXRSP
 - TXDAT
 - RXDAT
An RNI node sends request and response messages to the interconnect on the TXREQ and TXRSP channels respectively and receives response messages on RXRSP channel. The write data messages are sent on TXDAT and read data messages are received on RXDAT channel.
For more information please refer to the AMBA CHI Issue E.c Specification.</spirit:description>
