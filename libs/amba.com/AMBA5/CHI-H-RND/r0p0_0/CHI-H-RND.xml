    <spirit:description>The CHI RND interface is used by IO coherent nodes that process DVM messages. The RND interface consists of the following VCs:
 - TXREQ
 - TXRSP
 - RXRSP
 - TXDAT
 - RXDAT
 - RXSNP
An RND node sends request and response messages to the interconnect on the TXREQ and TXRSP channels respectively. It receives responses from the interconnect on RXRSP channel. It receives DVM requests and sends DVM responses on the RXSNP and TXRSP channels respectively. The write data messages are sent on TXDAT and read data messages are received on RXDAT channel.
For more information please refer to the AMBA CHI Specification.</spirit:description>
