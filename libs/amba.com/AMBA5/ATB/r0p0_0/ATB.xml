    <spirit:description>The ATB protocol is part of the AMBA protocol family.
The ATB protocol defines how trace information transfers between components in a trace system.
The ATB is a common bus used by the trace components to pass format-independent trace data through a CoreSight system.
A trace component or platform that has trace capabilities requires an ATB interface. The ATB interfaces are designated according to one of two functions:

    - Transmitter -&gt; An interface that generates trace data on the ATB interface.
    - Receiver -&gt; An interface that receives trace data on the ATB interface.

The ATB interface supports various features, including:

    1- stalling of data, using valid and ready responses
    2- control signals to indicate the number of bytes valid in a cycle
    3- originating component marker, each data packet has an associated ID
    4- any trace protocol information, data information or data format requirements
    5- identification of data from all originating components
    6- flushing
    7- distribution of synchronization request</spirit:description>
