  <spirit:description>The AMBA AXI protocol is targeted at high-performance, high-frequency system designs and includes a number of features that make it suitable for a high-speed submicron interconnect.
The objectives of the latest generation AMBA interface are to:
- be suitable for high-bandwidth and low-latency designs
- enable high-frequency operation without using complex bridges
- meet the interface requirements of a wide range of components
- be suitable for memory controllers with high initial access latency
- provide flexibility in the implementation of interconnect architectures
- be backward-compatible with existing AHB and APB interfaces.
The key features of the AXI protocol are:
- separate address/control and data phases
- support for unaligned data transfers using byte strobes
- burst-based transactions with only start address issued
- separate read and write data channels to enable low-cost Direct Memory Access (DMA)
- ability to issue multiple outstanding addresses
- out-of-order transaction completion
- easy addition of register stages to provide timing closure.
As well as the data transfer protocol, the AXI protocol includes optional extensions that cover signaling for low-power operation.
